# enhanced_coutingsort

enhanced_coutingsort is a enhancement of usual implementation of coutingsort algorithm. Traditional implementations work only in natural numbers set, 
and with enhanced_coutingsort, it is possible to sort negative integer numbers.

This implementation presented better performance when compared to other algorithms. For example, using the same arguments and features, a c implementation of quicksort
ordered an array of 10000000 numbers in 35 seconds, while enhanced_coutingsort sorted 50000000 numbers in 38 seconds in average.
